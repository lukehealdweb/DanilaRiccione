          <p id="story">We woke up scared and confused. I looked around and could see molten rock flowing like a river from the heavens, only this wasn't heaven. It was more like hell. The lava wasn't close enough to be dangerous but it was close enough to make us sweat, it was either that or the fact that I was very nervous.<br><br>I wasn't alone I was with my friends, Aziz, Artur, Vasily. Artur stood up proud looking at the vast open caves of the nether. Artur is tall has brownish black hair and is the builder of our group. He has built castles that block out the sun. I wish he could build a way out for us from this nightmare. 
          <br> Aziz was sat down sharpening our sword, he was the bravest of our group. Aziz once killed the wither all by himself which is no easy task.<br><br> Vasily is the last memeber of our group. He's the master of commands. He made a magic sword capable of killing everybody with one hit. Finally there's me. I'm the fighter and miner of our group, I'm the leader of this gang and now it's time to find out why we're here. </p>
