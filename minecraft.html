                We woke up scared and confused. I looked around and could see molten rock flowing like a river from the heavens. Only this wasn't heaven. It was more like hell. The lava wasn't close enough to be dangerous but it was close enough to make us sweat.<br> It was either that or the fact I was becomming very nervous. I wasn't alone I was with my friends. Aziz, Artur and Vasily. Artur was stood proudly looking at the vast open caves of the nether.<br> Artur is tall, has brownish black hair and is the builder of our group. He has built castle so big they have covered the sun. I wish he could build us a way out of this nightmare. Aziz was sat down sharpening our sword. He was the bravest member of our group. Aziz once killed the Wither all by himself, that's not an easy task. Vasily is the last memeber of our group and he's the master of commands. He made a magic sword capable of killing anyone with one hit. <br> Finally there is me, i'm the fighter and the miner of our group. I'm the leader of this gang and it's time to find out why we're here.
